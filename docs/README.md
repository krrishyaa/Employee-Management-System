Employee Management System 🧑‍💼
A simple command-line application built in C++ for basic employee record management. This project was developed as a foundational exercise to practice core programming concepts.

✨ Features
User Authentication: Allows users to sign up and log in using a simple username and password system.

Employee Records: Supports the basic management of employee data, including:

➕ Adding new employee records.

🖥️ Displaying a list of all employees.

✍️ Updating existing employee details by ID.

🗑️ Deleting an employee record by ID.

File-Based Storage: All user credentials and employee data are stored persistently in plain text files (users.txt and employees.txt).

💻 How to Run
Prerequisites
You need a C++ compiler (like g++ or MSVC) installed on your system.

Compilation
Navigate to the project's source directory in your terminal.

Compile the single source file using a command similar to this:

Bash

g++ main.cpp -o main
Execution
Run the compiled executable from the terminal:

Bash

./main
Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the system.

🚀 Future Improvements
This project serves as a basic prototype. Future versions will incorporate significant enhancements to improve functionality, security, and code quality, including:

Switching from file-based storage to a database, such as SQLite, for better data integrity and performance.

Refactoring the code into an object-oriented design with distinct classes to improve code readability and maintainability.

Adding robust input validation to prevent application crashes from invalid user input.

Implementing password hashing for enhanced security.
